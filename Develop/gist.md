## Regex Components

### Anchors

In the context of email validation, we often use the ^ and $ anchors to ensure the regex matches the entire string. The ^ asserts the start of the string, and $ asserts the end. In our email regex, ^[\w.-]+@[a-zA-Z\d.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$, they guarantee the email address is the complete string.

### Quantifiers

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
